The use of words from te reo Māori in the English variety spoken in New Zealand has been studied intensely over the past thirty years. Our project aims to contribute to this vbody of knowledge by building tools which help us analyse their use in Twitter. If you would like to see more on the study of te reo Māori in the NZ English - [here](https://www.calude.net/andreea/MaoriLoans.html) is a useful link with a detailed reference list.
