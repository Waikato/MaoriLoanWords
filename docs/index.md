# Māori Loanwords in Twitter
Code for analysing the usage of Māori Loanwords in New Zealand Tweets.

*It's cool to kōrero!* [Mai FM radio station]

The use of te reo Māori words in the English variety spoken in New Zealand and by New Zealanders has been studied intensely over the past thirty years. For example, when arriving in New Zealand, it is not uncommon to be greeted with the phrase "Kia ora!" at the airport.

Our project aims to contribute to this body of knowledge by building tools which help us analyse the use of Māori words in Twitter. If you would like to see more about the study of te reo Māori in the NZ English - [here](https://www.calude.net/andreea/MaoriLoans.html) is a useful link with a reference list. 

These pages detail the corpus of tweets we have collected, including how we went about clearning it and increasing its size using Machine Learning techniques. We also include some intial analyses we have conducted on this data. Our project developed from three main research questions:
(1) do people use Māori borrowings  (or loanwords) on Twitter?
(2) if so, which words, how do they use them, and how does this use compare with other genres of NZE?
(3) have the meanings of the borrowed words evolved through use and over time, and if so, how?
