# NZT Corpus
<br>
The <i>New Zealand Twitter Corpus (NZT Corpus)</i> is a diachronic corpus consisting of three components: 

1. <i>Raw Corpus</i>: 1.6 million Tweets that havested using the 77 'best' loanwords.
2. <i>Labelled Corpus</i>: 3,685 manually-coded Tweets which include at least one MƒÅori word of interest.
3. <i>Processed Corpus</i>: Just under 1.2 million Tweets that were classified as relevant, using the <i>Labelled Corpus</i> as training data. 

Below is a description of these components and a flowchart outlining how the <i>Processed Corpus</i> was built.
